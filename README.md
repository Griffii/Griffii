- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Griffii, your favorite tech loving cowboy living in Japan. 

I created griffiigames.com to help English teachers and students in Japan enjoy learning English with games and interactve tools!

Now I am developing the EITAKE App, a web app that allows schools to share English games with their teachers and students and customize what resources each class has access to.
I'm also working on an educational mystery VN for English learners: Detective Sosuke and the Missing Cake!
  
Thanks for visitng my profile. I hope there's something useful here for you to use!
